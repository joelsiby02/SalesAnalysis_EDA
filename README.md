# SalesAnalysis_EDA
EDA on a SalesAnalysis DataSet

Welcome to my Sale Analysis Project!

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a sales dataset that aims to uncover insights and patterns in sales data. In this project, I have utilized various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset.

To get started with this project, you will need to have some knowledge of data analysis and visualization techniques. The project includes the following files:

salesAnalysis.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for the analysis and EDA.

#I couldn't upload the 'merged_data_csv' file due to its large size. However, I have uploaded a zip file containing individual monthly CSV files, which you can merge to obtain the same data set. Please refer to my Jupyter notebook for the process and method I used.

README.md: This file contains a brief introduction to the project and instructions on how to run the Jupyter notebook.
In the salesAnalysis.ipynb notebook, I have implemented various functions and techniques such as grouping, filtering, merging, cleaning missing values, handling outliers, and visualizing the data with bar plots, scatter plots, line charts, box plots, heatmaps, and more.

Moreover, I have gained a deeper understanding of data analysis and EDA techniques, how to explore and manipulate data effectively, how to identify and handle data issues such as missing values and outliers, and how to use visualization techniques to gain insights into the data.

The main findings from the analysis are summarized in the sale_analysis.ipynb notebook, which includes various charts, graphs, and insights about the dataset.

To run the Jupyter notebook, you will need to install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:


pip install -r requirements.txt

Once the libraries are installed, you can open the Jupyter notebook using the following command

jupyter notebook salesAnalysis.ipynb


I hope you find this project useful and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me. Thank you for taking the time to explore my Sale Analysis Project
